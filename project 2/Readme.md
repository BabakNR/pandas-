# Sleepâ€‘Behavior Analysis ðŸ“ŠðŸ˜´

Analyse the impact of nightâ€‘time screenâ€‘time, caffeine intake, daily activity, and room temperature on sleep duration and perceived sleep quality.  
The project ships with a **synthetic, but realistic 90â€‘day dataset** and a full Jupyter notebook that explores correlations, visualises patterns, and clusters users into sleepâ€‘profile segments.

## Project structure

```
.
â”œâ”€ data/
â”‚  â””â”€ sleep_behavior.csv        # 90â€‘day synthetic dataset
â”œâ”€ notebooks/
â”‚  â””â”€ sleep_behavior_analysis.ipynb
â”œâ”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€ README.md
```

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<yourâ€‘user>/sleepâ€‘behavior-analysis.git
cd sleepâ€‘behavior-analysis

# 2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows â†’ .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook notebooks/sleep_behavior_analysis.ipynb
```

If `data/sleep_behavior.csv` is missing, the notebook automatically regenerates the dataset.

## Notebook walkâ€‘through

1. **Load & preview data** â€“ discover the schema and basic stats.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ distribution plots, boxâ€‘plots, scatterplots.  
3. **Correlation heatâ€‘map** â€“ identify key features linked to sleep duration.  
4. **Clustering** â€“ Kâ€‘Means groups users into three archetypes:  
   - _Highâ€‘energy shortâ€‘sleepers_  
   - _Balanced sleepers_  
   - _Lowâ€‘activity poorâ€‘sleepers_  
5. **Insights & next steps** â€“ lays out potential extensions (wearable data, predictive models, personalised recommendations).

## How the synthetic data are generated

See the first cell in the notebook (or `scripts/generate_data.py`, if you extract the code) â€“ NumPy draws realistic distributions for bedâ€‘times, wakeâ€‘up times, caffeine, steps, etc., then tags each day with a **sleep_quality** label (`goodâ€¯|â€¯averageâ€¯|â€¯poor`) based on simple heuristics.

## Extending the project

* Swap in your own real data â€“ preserve column names or adjust the load step.  
* Add featureâ€‘engineering (e.g. rolling averages, circadianâ€‘rhythm features).  
* Train a supervised classifier to *predict* `sleep_quality` from the numeric features.  
* Deploy results as a Streamlit or Dash dashboard.
